# Shakespearean Transformer Text Generator

![Shakespearean Transformer](./shake_trans.png)

Welcome to the Shakespearean Transformer Text Generator project! In this endeavor, we explore the depths of Transformers, a groundbreaking technology in the field of natural language processing. Our objective is to craft a text generation model that can emulate the eloquent and poetic style of the renowned playwright, William Shakespeare.

## Project Overview

The advent of Transformers has revolutionized language modeling and generation tasks. Drawing inspiration from this advancement, our project aims to train a Transformer model using Shakespearean text as its primary training dataset. The resultant model will possess the capability to generate text that embodies the distinct linguistic traits of Shakespeare's literary works.

## Key Components

- **Transformers:** We delve into the intricacies of Transformer architecture, understanding its mechanisms for attention, context fusion, and parallelization. Through this, we gain a profound insight into how Transformers have transformed the NLP landscape.

- **Text Generation:** At the heart of our project lies the ability to generate text. By training our model on Shakespearean text, we unlock its potential to generate text passages that resonate with the stylistic nuances and vocabulary of Shakespeare.

- **Customizability:** The project offers the flexibility to customize the model architecture and training parameters afecting to the text generation results, for example we could make the same for differents writters.
